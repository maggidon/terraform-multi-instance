Terraform AWS Multi-Instance Deployment (3 EC2 Servers)

This project uses Terraform to automatically create three EC2 instances on AWS — complete with a shared security group, reusable variables, and clean outputs.

⸻

What This Project Does

Terraform automatically:

✔️ Creates 3 EC2 instances (server-1, server-2, server-3)
✔️ Creates 1 shared security group → SSH + internal VPC traffic
✔️ Assigns tags to each instance
✔️ Outputs public & private IPs of all servers
✔️ Uses variables to customize region, instance type, and count
✔️ Clean project structure just like real DevOps teams use
